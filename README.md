# Azure Platform for GSP and ASP Solutions
Onset of GST regime in India is a critical and a very strategic transition for India in the realm of indirect taxation with far reaching impact on ease of doing business, commerce, services &amp; manufacturing, logistics and countryâ€™s economic progress in general. As the country transitions to these new set of rules, GSPs and GST ASPs are positioned as critical levers to enable this IT enabled transition. GSPs have limited time to understand the new set of rules, which are rapidly evolving, develop a solution and host and run it on a secure and scalable platform. 

The purpose of this project is to help GSPs and ASPs understand how Azure DC platform, available in India, can help address most of the key challenges in building and operating a successful GST solution.

Please refer to the "**Azure Platform for GSP_<version>.pdf**" document and the **Wiki** pages for discussions and suggestions to build robust GSP and ASP solution on Azure.

Do share your feedback and suggestions.
